                <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk</strong>: Because all the most delicious recipes call for a can of sweetened condensed milk.</li>

                <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: A tablespoon of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the Spanish flan.</li>

            <h2>STEPS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom and sides; set aside.</li>
                <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture into the baking dish; cover with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Let cool completely.</li>
                <li>To serve, carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate; let caramel sauce flow over flan.</li>
