            <h2>STEPS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix chicken, curry leaves, yogurt, garlic paste, chili powder, coriander, garam masala, and ginger together. Cover and let marinate in a refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Add a few drops of red food coloring and mix so that chicken becomes tinted with red.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil, working in batches, and fry, stirring frequently, until browned and no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.</li>
