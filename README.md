# odin-recipes
A project made for the Odin Project that I've been working on.

I've been learning from the Odin Project and I'm just starting out on my coding journey.
In this repository, I have listed three of my favourite food in the order of starter, main course and dessert.

The site is located at: https://kazuya48.github.io/odin-recipes/

Hope you like it.
